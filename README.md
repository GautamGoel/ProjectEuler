ProjectEuler
============

My solutions to Project Euler problems. I like to play around with different languages and styles; most solutions are written in OCaml, Haskell, Go, C, or Lisp (SBCL). I find those languages to be pretty elegant. I might also include some solutions written in Python, Java, C++, Standard ML.
