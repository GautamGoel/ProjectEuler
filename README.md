ProjectEuler
============

My solutions to Project Euler problems. I like to play around with different languages and styles; most solutions are in Haskell, OCaml, or Go. I find those languages to be pretty elegant. I plan on also dipping into C, C++, and x86 Assembly when I feel like getting close to the metal for maximum performance. And maybe I'll use some Java when I'm feeling lazy.
